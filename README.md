# Natural Language Processor

## Overview

This app uses natural language processing (NLP) to predict a user's next word based on previous input. The code is written in R, and its interface is a Shiny app.

The app has been developed through the capstone project in [The Johns Hopkins University's Data Science specializiation on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).
